     fullText: "Many households in Ethiopia have faced hardships as a result of the conflict and the economic crisis. THE MAGI starts its first work by helping displaced children in Debre Birhan city as a matter of urgency then followed by children school support in Adama city we are so much blessed with what we achieved.   \n  Currently THE MAGI family realised that so many families in Addis Ababa city especially those who are very poor are challenged for survival. We have many children in our waiting list all of them from very poor family. To mention some of their cases, some parents have no food to feed their children and some children have health problems; some parents not have good health to help their kids, some care to their grand children but no strength and poor. So THE MAGI worked well on those family cases and planed to reach out them through support for food provision, facilitate family health insurance access and school support at least two children per family. To accomplish what THE MAGA planed above it cost as 150$ per/child for one year that means the support will be given every month. The mentioned cost above is a lump sum including admin cost too.",

Huziefa is in fourth grade while Enib is in kindergarten. The fort behind them hanging by a couple of large sticks is the place they have been calling home for the past two years. The father of these stars is half paralyzed, suffers from high blood pressure and is also a diabetic.\n        While some are orphans, many have families but grew up in slum-like settlements in extreme poverty.\n        Their mother Jemil provides for them by collecting and selling bottles and plastic bags, and sometimes if she's lucky is able to make money by washing other peoples dirty clothes. Even through the struggle of trying to survive this hard life, Jamil is putting up a brave fight for her children. She is the definition of a true mother a warrior at that.\n        Even through these hard circumstances Jemil is paying the price to put her children through school in hopes of one day seeing them escape the hardships they are currently facing. Imagine how far these children with so much hope could go if they had some support. Imagine the rest this hard working warrior of a mother will feel when her children are being properly educated. The Magi aims to support and address the lives of children like Huziefa and Enib.",
